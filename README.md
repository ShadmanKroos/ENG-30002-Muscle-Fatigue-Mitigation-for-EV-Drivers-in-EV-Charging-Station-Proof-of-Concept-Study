# ENG-30002-Muscle-Fatigue-Mitigation-for-EV-Drivers-in-EV-Charging-Station-Proof-of-Concept-Study

This project presents a fully autonomous, solar-powered electric vehicle (EV) charging station developed using MATLAB - Simulink for data analysis, and system-level simulation. The off-grid system is powered entirely by photovoltaic (PV) solar energy and integrates biomedical engineering concepts to address driver muscle fatigue experienced during EV charging periods.

The energy management architecture is modeled and validated in MATLAB Simulink, with dedicated subsystems for photovoltaic power regulation, battery management, and controlled power flow between the PV source, EV load, and energy storage. An Arduino-based controller continuously monitors solar generation and EV power demand, dynamically allocating excess energy to support an integrated therapeutic massage system.

Muscle fatigue in the hands and feet is assessed using surface electromyography (sEMG) and optically pumped magnetometers (OPMs), with signal acquisition and processing performed in MATLAB. Real-time physiological data is processed by AI algorithms that adapt massage intensity, technique, and target regions based on individual fatigue levels. The system implements multiple therapeutic methods, including pressing, kneading, tapping, and flapping, and prioritizes highly fatigued muscle groups before extending treatment to surrounding areas for progressive relief.

The design incorporates comprehensive electrical safety features, including voltage and current regulation, DC–AC conversion, overload protection, surge suppression, and robust system-level safety mechanisms.
